Advantages:
- isolated urbits

- works with stars

Usage:
1. set up your Urbit locally and copy your `+code` - make sure you delete your keyfile after booting the first time!
2. `./run.sh sampel-palnet ~/path/to/sampel-palnet/ 80`
3. Go to http://localhost and log in using your code

To see logs:
```
docker logs -f urbit-sampel-palnet
```

To see if your container is running:
```
docker ps
```

TODO:
- docker compose
- make build/run script detect if container is running
- make scripts upgrade container
- add reverse proxy + letsencrypt support
- cronjob to rotate logs
- graceful shutdown of urbit process when running `docker stop`
